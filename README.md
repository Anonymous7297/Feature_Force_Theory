--The codes of clustering method based on Feature Force 
--Since some of our code uses TAC (ICML 2024)'s code, in order for researchers to encounter unnecessary trouble in the reproduction process, please be consistent with the library version required by TAC
-- It is important to note that due to the randomness of ResNet50, it is reasonable to have a small change in the final clustering results, so we also provide the required running files that are exactly the same as the results in this paper
